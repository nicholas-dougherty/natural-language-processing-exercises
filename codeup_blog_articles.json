Now, we are excited to announce our newest coming-soon program: Cloud Administration! Learn to build and manage cloud-based solutions.\nWhat is the cloud? \nIn short, the cloud lets you utilize the power of other people\u2019s computers and infrastructure. Instead of having to run everything on your own computer (and dealing with pesky problems of storage, security, and reliability), you can instantly tap into the cloud to utilize the power of companies that specialize in these areas, like AWS, Google, and Microsoft.\nWhy the cloud? \nThe future is in the cloud! As the new way of doing business, all companies need to build or interact with cloud products. And these aren\u2019t just high-tech solutions \u2013 they\u2019re the core of everyday products like cloud-based gaming from Xbox, collaborative work tools from Google Drive, and even music streaming services from Spotify.\nWhat will we learn? \nThe Cloud Administration program will be a 15-week career accelerator that marries the best of our Systems Engineering and Cyber Cloud programs. With hands-on training in networking, Linux, Windows, security, and AWS Cloud, we\u2019ll prepare you for entry-level jobs like Cloud Specialist, Cloud Administrator, and Cloud Engineer. Learn to build infrastructure that enables software and data science products, manage cloud deployments, and optimize for cloud performance.\n\nWho is this program for? \nIf coding or statistics aren\u2019t your things, but you\u2019re interested in a career in tech, this is the program for you. Tinkerers, computer enthusiasts, mechanics, gamers \u2013 anyone who likes to fix and build things will love this program. With this foundation, students will be launched into IT towards careers in Cloud Architecture, Cybersecurity, DevOps, and Solutions Engineering.\nWhen will the program launch? \nWe anticipate starting our inaugural class in late May.

What better way to do that than celebrate female authors! These women have written phenomenal books in the tech space to tell their stories. These are women who have walked the walk in the tech world and\/or offered unique perspectives to not just women in tech, but women in the workplace. This list goes in no particular order as we believe you should add all of these to your kindle or book library asap. You can click on each book image to take you to a purchase page on Amazon.\nLet\u2019s dive into the list below:\nReset: My Fight for Inclusion and Lasting Change by Ellen Pao\nFrom the book\u2019s description on Amazon:\n\u201cIn 2015, Ellen K. Pao sued a powerhouse Silicon Valley venture capital firm, calling out workplace discrimination and retaliation against women and other underrepresented groups. Her suit rocked the tech world\u2014and exposed its toxic culture and its homogeneity. Her message overcame negative PR attacks that took aim at her professional conduct and her personal life, and she won widespread public support\u2014Time hailed her as \u201cthe face of change.\u201d Though Pao lost her suit, she revolutionized the conversation at tech offices, in the media, and around the world. In Reset, she tells her full story for the first time.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\nFemale Innovators at Work: Women on Top of Tech by Danielle Newnham\u00a0\nFrom the book\u2019s description on Amazon:\n\u201cThis book describes the experiences and successes of female innovators and entrepreneurs in the still largely male-dominated tech world in twenty candid interviews. It highlights the varied life and career stories that lead these women to the top positions in the technology industry that they are in now.\nInterviewees include CEOs, founders, and inventors from a wide spectrum of tech organizations across sectors as varied as mobile technology, e-commerce, online education, and video games. Interviewer Danielle Newnham, a mobile startup and e-commerce entrepreneur herself as well as an online community organizer, presents the insights, instructive anecdotes, and advice shared with her in the interviews, including stories about raising capital for one\u2019s start-up, and about the obstacles these women encountered and how they overcame them.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\nTechnically Wrong: Sexist Apps, Biased Algorithms, and Other Threats of Toxic Tech by Sara Wachter-Boettcher\nFrom the book\u2019s description on Amazon:\n\u201cBuying groceries, tracking our health, finding a date: whatever we want to do, odds are that we can now do it online. But few of us ask how all these digital products are designed, or why. It\u2019s time we change that. Many of the services we rely on are full of oversights, biases, and downright ethical nightmares. Chatbots that harass women. Signup forms that fail anyone who\u2019s not straight. Social media sites that send peppy messages about dead relatives. Algorithms that put more black people behind bars.\u00a0\nTechnically Wrong takes an unflinching look at the values, processes, and assumptions that lead to these problems and more. Wachter-Boettcher demystifies the tech industry, leaving those of us on the other side of the screen better prepared to make informed choices about the services we use \u2013 and demand more from the companies behind them.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\nBrotopia: Breaking Up the Boys\u2019 Club of Silicon Valley by Emily Chang\nFrom the book\u2019s description on Amazon:\n\u201cSilicon Valley is not a fantasyland of unicorns, virtual reality rainbows, and 3D-printed lollipops for women in tech. Instead, it\u2019s a \u201cBrotopia,\u201d where men hold the cards and make the rules. While millions of dollars may seem to grow on trees in this land of innovation, tech\u2019s aggressive, misogynistic, work-at-all costs culture has shut women out of the greatest wealth creation in the history of the world.\nBrotopia reveals how Silicon Valley got so sexist despite its utopian ideals, why bro culture endures even as its companies claim the moral high ground, and how women are speaking out and fighting back. Drawing on her deep network of Silicon Valley insiders, Chang opens the boardroom doors of male-dominated venture capital firms like Kleiner Perkins, the subject of Ellen Pao\u2019s high-profile gender discrimination lawsuit, and Sequoia, where a partner once famously said they \u201cwon\u2019t lower their standards\u201d just to hire women. Exposing the flawed logic in common excuses for why tech has long suffered the \u201cpipeline\u201d problem and invests in the delusion of meritocracy, Brotopia also shows how bias coded into AI, internet troll culture, and the reliance on pattern recognition harms not just women in tech but us all, and at an unprecedented scale.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\nLife in Code: A Personal History of Technology by Ellen Ullman\nFrom the book\u2019s description on Amazon:\n\u201cThe last twenty years have brought us the rise of the internet, the development of artificial intelligence, the ubiquity of once unimaginably powerful computers, and the thorough transformation of our economy and society. Through it all, Ellen Ullman lived and worked inside that rising culture of technology, and in Life in Code she tells the continuing story of the changes it wrought with a unique, expert perspective.\nWhen Ellen Ullman moved to San Francisco in the early 1970s and went on to become a computer programmer, she was joining a small, idealistic, and almost exclusively male cadre that aspired to genuinely change the world. In 1997 Ullman wrote Close to the Machine, the now classic and still definitive account of life as a coder at the birth of what would be a sweeping technological, cultural, and financial revolution.\nTwenty years later, the story Ullman recounts is neither one of unbridled triumph nor a nostalgic denial of progress. It is necessarily the story of digital technology\u2019s loss of innocence as it entered the cultural mainstream, and it is a personal reckoning with all that has changed, and so much that hasn\u2019t. Life in Code is an essential text toward our understanding of the last twenty years\u2013and the next twenty.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\nLet us know your thoughts on this list on social media!

And not only for their products, but also for the certifications they offer. If you\u2019re new to tech, you might be wondering: Do certifications really matter? Welcome to IT Certifications 101! What\u2019s the tl;dr? Certifications are critical to getting past HR for certain roles, but they won\u2019t get you the job.\nWhat are IT Certifications?\nCertifications are official credentials given by companies, institutions, and vendors to verify that you have demonstrated a specific knowledge or skill. They are a stamp of approval from a known brand (like Amazon) saying \u201cThis person knows their stuff.\u201d Certs are used in a lot of industries, including technology. Even within tech, there are dozens of vendors and hundreds of certs.\nWhy do IT Certifications matter to employers?\nMany roles (including security, system administration, and networking) require certain certs to make it in the door of an interview process. This filter matters for several reasons: it helps narrow down the pool of applicants, it establishes a baseline of shared knowledge or experience across all applicants, and it expedites the process so that employers don\u2019t have to spend as much time vetting basic technical skills.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy do they matter to you?\nObtaining certs in IT will provide you with a number of benefits:\n\nYou will show up in recruiter searches on LinkedIn!\nYou can follow specific, concrete paths for your career development\nYou obtain industry-recognized, respected, and transferable credentials relevant for your whole career\nYou develop relevant and broad-base content knowledge\nYou will be able to pass initial HR screenings and land a seat in the interview\n\nWhy DON\u2019T they matter to employers and you?\nAt the end of the day, certifications are just pieces of paper. They represent your ability to pass a test, not to do a job. Sometimes those things are one and the same, but usually, they are very different. Certifications are like the entrance fee to get into a tournament: you still need to fight your way to the top. And when you\u2019re standing in the ring, it\u2019s better to know how to fight than to have a degree in fighting.\nAdditionally, not all jobs within tech care about certifications at all. For example, there is technically a Java programming certification from Oracle, but it\u2019s almost never required or considered for job applications because it tests very specific, abnormal, and academic concepts that don\u2019t apply to most real-world software development.\nIf Certs matter AND don\u2019t matter, what do I do?\nAt Codeup, we like to think of our IT training as CertificationsPLUS, as in \u2013 you get certifications PLUS hands-on experience. Here\u2019s a quick way to think about it: Amazon Web Services has basic certifications called Cloud Practitioner and Solutions Architect Associate. The official Amazon training for these certs is 1 week: 4 days of training and 1 day of exam readiness. The 1-week schedule will present to you mostly everything you need to pass the certification exam, and then it\u2019s on you to go cram and memorize to get ready. Once you pass, you\u2019ll have the cert, but you\u2019ll be a paper tiger: all bark and no bite. In other words, you\u2019ll appear knowledgeable and skillful on paper, but in reality, you won\u2019t have any experience or know-how for completing the real work.\nAlternatively, Codeup spends 5 weeks on AWS, combining exam study and hands-on practice. That way, you can talk the talk and walk the walk.\nIf you want to learn more about IT certification and training paths, reach out to us at info@codeup.com!"},{"title":"A rise in cyber attacks means opportunities for veterans in San Antonio","published":"Nov 17, 2021","content":"In the last few months, the US has experienced dozens of major cyberattacks against leading organizations like Accenture, the NBA, and Kia Motors. Similar attacks are on the rise. This year, 38% more companies have experienced cyber attacks as compared to last year. Often, they involve a ransom payment in order to re-access stolen files. The amount paid by these victims has increased by 300%. In our headquarters of San Antonio, Texas, even local organizations are at risk. Recently, Judson ISD paid a $500,000 ransom.\nIn 2020, there were over 300,000 open roles for cybersecurity professionals in the US. To add to that, the US Bureau of Labor Statistics predicts a 31% increase in Information Security roles in the upcoming years. As attacks are on the rise, the demand for cybersecurity professionals is quickly increasing. But with so many open roles, the issue isn\u2019t demand \u2013 it\u2019s supply.\nLuckily, San Antonio is already a national leader in cybersecurity. We have over 16,000 employees in the field, which is the most certified cyber professionals outside of D.C.. With industry giants like USAA and Lockheed Martin in the city, we have a good footing over much of the country. Moreover, San Antonio is Military City, USA. We\u2019re home to one of the largest populations of bases, veterans, and active service members in the country. With both these backgrounds, the city is well-positioned to continue to lead our country\u2019s defense \u2013 not just traditionally, but in cyber warfare as well. \nBut we still need more help. What can we do about it? Train more cybersecurity professionals. Organizations like Project Quest have supported cybersecurity training for years. But we can\u2019t rely solely on non-profit funding. There are plenty of opportunities for veterans to enter the field with VA benefits. Training programs like Codeup Cloud Academy are approved to accept GI Bill\u00ae and Vocational Rehab. This allows veterans to receive housing support while getting the cybersecurity training they need in our Cyber Cloud program.\nWant to keep San Antonio safe and positioned as a leader in Cybersecurity? Help us train the next generation of cybersecurity professionals! Connect us with veterans in your network so we can all help continue San Antonio\u2019s tradition of protecting our city and country!"},{"title":"Use your GI Bill\u00ae benefits to Land a Job in Tech","published":"Nov 4, 2021","content":"As the end of military service gets closer, many transitioning service members often ask, \u201cCan the GI Bill\u00ae pay for a coding bootcamp?\u201d The answer is yes, but only if the coding bootcamp is on the VA-approved list.\nThe GI Bill\u00ae will pay for college or a VA-approved coding bootcamp. For bootcamp programs, the VA uses a formula to calculate how much time to deduct from your benefits based on the program\u2019s tuition and how it compares to average college costs.\nThat\u2019s good news for veterans looking for a second career in the technology sector. The tech industry is fast-paced, action-oriented, and often focused on completing small goals to accomplish large ones, a familiar process for those trained by the military. With average salaries for entry-level programmers averaging around $80,000, it\u2019s a great time to learn how to code and get paid for your expertise.\nWhy attend a coding bootcamp instead of college?\nYou could always attend a two- or four-year college degree program in computer science and learn software development. Or you could train for these jobs by completing a specialized bootcamp program.\nCoding bootcamps teach widely used programming languages and frameworks like Ruby on Rails, Python on Django, JavaScript, and PHP stacks through project-based learning. Students graduate from bootcamps with a portfolio, an online presence, interview skills, and more. Most courses even help graduates find an internship or match students with an employer network.\nA bootcamp is an immersive, intense full-time learning environment. Students should prepare to scale back outside activities and give up full-time employment for the program\u2019s course. Coding bootcamps vary in length from six to 28 weeks, although the average time is about 14 weeks long. Military service members transitioning from active duty to veteran status can often leverage terminal leave to attend a coding bootcamp.\nIf you\u2019re still wondering whether to choose a college program or a tech career accelerator, here are some points to consider:\n\nCollege isn\u2019t for everyone. You may not have the time or money for four years of study or aren\u2019t interested in all the extras that come with college life.\nGI Bill\u00ae education benefits can pay for tuition, housing, and other associated costs of attending an approved bootcamp, much like when you attend college.\nInterviewers for coding and developer jobs evaluate you on practical skills and experience, not your academic performance. Many bootcamps feature a Capstone project, in-depth work to solve a problem that becomes part of your portfolio so you can show potential employers what you can do.\nMany bootcamps have job placement programs to help you find an internship or land a job after graduation.\nIn some cases, bootcamp programs will offer a job guarantee within a certain amount of time after graduation, or they will refund your tuition costs.\n\nWhat should veterans look for in a Bootcamp?\nA tech workforce development program usually translates into extensive, hands-on instruction in say, learning how to write code in less time than it takes to complete a two- or four-year degree program. Some bootcamps may be offered through established state or private universities, while some private providers offer training programs.\nWhat should you look for in a bootcamp?\n\nThe bootcamp should meet the criteria as a VA-approved institution. Some coding schools may have only some programs that are GI Bill\u00ae eligible, but not others.\nBootcamps typically can adapt to changes in the tech industry faster than a college. Ask if the curriculum incorporates feedback from industry partners and is updated to teach the latest practices.\nCoding bootcamps should be training students in practical skills. Will you get to work with a client or organization on a project? See if the program you\u2019re interested in offers a Capstone project or an internship as part of the curriculum.\nA successful bootcamp ensures its students get the jobs they are trained to do, so check on job placement resources and guarantees. Resume help, interview training, and a robust network of industry partners interested in hiring graduates means better chances of getting that sought-after tech job.\nA school offering a tuition refund guarantee is aligning its business incentives with the interests of its students. If students aren\u2019t successful, then neither is the school.

You could become a web developer or data scientist or study UI\/UX and graphic design. Or for those of you reading right now, you might be looking at entering a career in networking, cybersecurity, or cloud administration. Which might lead you to ask: what\u2019s the difference, and which program is right for me?\nBoth these programs are 13-weeks long. While they have different names, they share a lot of similar content as entry-level IT accelerators. Of the seven technical modules, four of them are shared. Both cover:\n\nNetworking \u2013 Gain in-depth exposure to networks and topics across the OSI model,\u00a0 networks, protocols, and packet Capture, network analysis, and more.\nLinux \u2013 Gain exposure and get hands-on configuring and maintaining the Linux operating system.\nWindows \u2013 Exposure to the Windows Server 2012 R2 Operating System to learn server management functions using Server Manager and basic command-line utilities and tools to run from the command prompt.\nAWS \u2013 Become familiar with key industry terms and concepts while building a foundation of cloud product knowledge across Amazon Web Services.\n\nNetworking, Linux, Windows, and AWS are a LOT of content for new IT employees. Outside of this content, the programs split into their areas of focus:\n\nCyber Cloud gets students certified in Security+ and AWS\nSystems Engineering gets students certified in Network+ and Linux+\n\nNow that you understand where the programs are similar and where they differ, which one is right for you? Here are some questions to consider:\n\nDo I have any technical work experience?\nDo I have any training or education in IT?\nDo you prefer solving open-ended and ambiguous problems, or concrete problems with solutions?\nAre you interested in building and developing systems, or in securing and protecting systems?\n\nIf you don\u2019t have any work or education in IT, the Systems Engineering program is the one for you. It is designed to be the 0-1 step in your IT career to get you started! If you do have work experience or education in IT, then you might be interested in Cyber Cloud. Why is that?\nOur programs focus on CompTIA certifications, which is a major industry provider in technical training. The typical track through their IT certifications is to start with their A+, then complete their Network +, and then progress to their Security +. That means if you don\u2019t have your Network + (or relevant experience), it can be really hard to catch up.\nStill not sure which is right for you?

But if you\u2019re new to tech, you might be wondering\u2026what is Systems Engineering?\nWhat is Systems Engineering?\nIn IT terms, a Systems Engineer (Sysadmin or Sysad for short) is responsible for the configuration, upkeep, and operation of computer systems. They manage things like security, storage, automation, troubleshooting, and a whole lot more. For example, some of the day to day tasks include things like:\n\nReviewing system logs for anomalies and issues\nUpdating operating systems (OS)\nInstalling new hardware and software\nManaging user accounts\nDocumenting information about the system setup\nManaging file systems\n\nYou might be thinking, \u201cWoah, that looks like a lot!\u201d and that\u2019s because it is! A Systems Engineer is a critical piece of IT infrastructure. And in today\u2019s digital age, all companies are IT companies, which means Sysadmins are critical everywhere. You can think of a Sysad as a jack-of-all-trades of what we typically think of as IT. But don\u2019t forget how the old saying actually ends: \u201cA jack of all trades is a master of none, but oftentimes better than a master of none.\u201d So, what are the skills a Sysadmin uses?\n\nNetworking \u2013 Networking skills include how to configure, maintain, and troubleshoot networks, including using hardware like switches, routers, and firewalls. These skills and concepts are crucial to any systems engineering position. You not only need to understand them but also need some way to prove it. With the Network+ certification, job seekers can come to employers with proof of their networking know-how.\nLinux- Linux is one of the most popular Operating Systems (OS). It is fully compatible with Mac OS and underpins all Android systems. In fact, the world\u2019s IT infrastructure is run primarily on Linux. Certifications are the primary way technical folks prove their skills and Linux is no different. The CompTIA Linux+ certification is an entry-level certification that proves knowledge and basic technical proficiency in the job role\nCloud \u2013 This involves using servers and tools (i.e. processing and storage hardware) that are based in a different location, instead of on-site. Our program introduces students to cloud concepts like storage, computing, permissions, and more!\n\nWhy Become a Systems Engineer?\nNow you know what a Sysadmin does and what skills they use. But why become a Sysadmin? The world is increasingly dependent on computer systems and their underlying technologies. Configuring computer software, designing innovative solutions for specific problems, and basic troubleshooting skills are more and more in demand each year.\u00a0 Without systems engineers, the technical world would stop innovating and become stagnant.\n\nThey are in demand! Companies rely on Sysadmins to keep all their IT running\nYou\u2019ll become a tech guru! You won\u2019t just be the person who can fix the printer. You\u2019ll also be the person who can script, work with servers, navigate AWS Cloud tools, and work on modern web technologies.\nYou can specialize! With the breadth of knowledge you\u2019ll obtain, you can have a specialized career in IT. Just hone in on one of your interests, whether it\u2019s security, cloud, databases, or something that doesn\u2019t even exist yet!\n\nInterested in learning more?

I would go from home to home working with children anywhere from 1 year old to 18 years old. After 5 years of the profession, my body was getting tired driving around all the time and I felt overworked. The work was satisfying and I do miss working with the kiddos, but I just felt drained. I knew it was time to find a different field, so I started thinking about what else I was good at.\nThen one day as I was on my way to a patient\u2019s home, I found a Codeup billboard near Splashtown that said \u201cdrive to a job you love\u201d and I took it as a sign. I thought, \u201cI want to drive to a job I love!\u201d I had also heard nothing but good things about Codeup from a friend that went the Web Development route. She answered my questions and helped me through the whole process.\nAt first, I was a little worried about tuition payment, but once I got started in the application process, they held Zoom meetings where they would talk about all the funding options. They made it really easy and addressed all of my concerns. I realized I didn\u2019t have to be scared about the financial aspect. I applied to a couple of grants and was able to get about a third of my tuition covered through the Train for Jobs SA grant from Workforce Solutions Alamo. That really helped me. I also received a few different scholarships from Codeup. The rest of it was a loan from Meritize.\nIt was difficult leaving something I was comfortable and familiar with to start something new with no data science background, but I have always enjoyed all things tech. Once we got into the pre-assessment work and then the prework leading up to class, it showed me, \u201cokay this IS what I wanted to be doing.\u201d I really enjoyed it, thought it was fun, and realized this was for me.\nOverall, I really enjoyed the program. We were in Zoom the whole time because of the pandemic, but they made it slow, nice, and easy. The instructors are absolutely wonderful. Every single instructor helped me at one point or another, teaching things from ground zero and explaining everything really nicely in a way I can understand. One thing I value the most about the instructors is that, not only do they go over all the necessary skills needed in a data-related career, but they teach us how to learn the skills as well. They didn\u2019t just give us the work and tell us exactly how to do it. They provide instruction, hands-on exercises\/projects, and answers to all questions, but most importantly, they walk us through how to work with the data and obtain the answers on our own. This is extremely valuable as I believe it is the key to success in this field.\nNow after graduating from Codeup, I\u2019m a Business Intelligence Analyst at Liquid Web. I\u2019ve been here almost three months now and I\u2019m contributing to so many projects. I really feel like a true member of the team. I can figure things out for myself and my bosses are telling me how well I\u2019m doing and how far I\u2019ve come since working here. I didn\u2019t have to ask for much help or training, because Codeup prepared me well and taught me how to learn when I run into skills they don\u2019t teach. It\u2019s been really good.\nI\u2019m so glad I made this change. It was scary to take that leap of faith, but ultimately, I\u2019m really glad I did. I love my job and I love what I\u2019m doing. If anyone is looking to make a career change and struggling to find their best fit, I recommend looking into Codeup and going through their process. I\u2019m extremely happy where I am right now and wouldn\u2019t change a thing."},{"title":"Boris \u2013 Behind the Billboards","published":"Oct 3, 2021","content":""},{"title":"Is Codeup the Best Bootcamp in San Antonio\u2026or the World?","published":"Sep 16, 2021","content":"Looking for the best data science bootcamp in the world?
