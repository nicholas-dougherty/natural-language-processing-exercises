    "\n",
    "3. Define a function named stem. It should accept some text and return the text after applying stemming to all the words.\n",

    "- If your corpus is 493KB, would you prefer to use stemmed or lemmatized text?\n",
    "- If your corpus is 25MB, would you prefer to use stemmed or lemmatized text?\n",

Now, we are excited to announce our newest coming-soon program: Cloud Administration! Learn to build and manage cloud-based solutions.\\nWhat is the cloud? \\nIn short, the cloud lets you utilize the power of other people’s computers and infrastructure. Instead of having to run everything on your own computer (and dealing with pesky problems of storage, security, and reliability), you can instantly tap into the cloud to utilize the power of companies that specialize in these areas, like AWS, Google, and Microsoft.\\nWhy the cloud? \\nThe future is in the cloud! As the new way of doing business, all companies need to build or interact with cloud products. And these aren’t just high-tech solutions – they’re the core of everyday products like cloud-based gaming from Xbox, collaborative work tools from Google Drive, and even music streaming services from Spotify.\\nWhat will we learn? \\nThe Cloud Administration program will be a 15-week career accelerator that marries the best of our Systems Engineering and Cyber Cloud programs. With hands-on training in networking, Linux, Windows, security, and AWS Cloud, we’ll prepare you for entry-level jobs like Cloud Specialist, Cloud Administrator, and Cloud Engineer. Learn to build infrastructure that enables software and data science products, manage cloud deployments, and optimize for cloud performance.\\n\\nWho is this program for? \\nIf coding or statistics aren’t your things, but you’re interested in a career in tech, this is the program for you. Tinkerers, computer enthusiasts, mechanics, gamers – anyone who likes to fix and build things will love this program. With this foundation, students will be launched into IT towards careers in Cloud Architecture, Cybersecurity, DevOps, and Solutions Engineering.\\nWhen will the program launch? \\nWe anticipate starting our inaugural class in late May. With only 20 seats available in the inaugural class, space is limited. Sign up now to be the first to hear about the launch of our Cloud Administration program!\\n\\n\\nBe the first know when the Cloud Administration program launches by signing up on this page here.</td>\n",

       "      <td>On this International Women’s Day 2022 we wanted to tell stories about women in tech. What better way to do that than celebrate female authors! These women have written phenomenal books in the tech space to tell their stories. These are women who have walked the walk in the tech world and/or offered unique perspectives to not just women in tech, but women in the workplace. This list goes in no particular order as we believe you should add all of these to your kindle or book library asap. You can click on each book image to take you to a purchase page on Amazon.\\nLet’s dive into the list below:\\nReset: My Fight for Inclusion and Lasting Change by Ellen Pao\\nFrom the book’s description on Amazon:\\n“In 2015, Ellen K. Pao sued a powerhouse Silicon Valley venture capital firm, calling out workplace discrimination and retaliation against women and other underrepresented groups. Her suit rocked the tech world—and exposed its toxic culture and its homogeneity. Her message overcame negative PR attacks that took aim at her professional conduct and her personal life, and she won widespread public support—Time hailed her as “the face of change.” Though Pao lost her suit, she revolutionized the conversation at tech offices, in the media, and around the world. In Reset, she tells her full story for the first time.”\\n\\n \\nFemale Innovators at Work: Women on Top of Tech by Danielle Newnham \\nFrom the book’s description on Amazon:\\n“This book describes the experiences and successes of female innovators and entrepreneurs in the still largely male-dominated tech world in twenty candid interviews. It highlights the varied life and career stories that lead these women to the top positions in the technology industry that they are in now.\\nInterviewees include CEOs, founders, and inventors from a wide spectrum of tech organizations across sectors as varied as mobile technology, e-commerce, online education, and video games. Interviewer Danielle Newnham, a mobile startup and e-commerce entrepreneur herself as well as an online community organizer, presents the insights, instructive anecdotes, and advice shared with her in the interviews, including stories about raising capital for one’s start-up, and about the obstacles these women encountered and how they overcame them.”\\n\\n \\nTechnically Wrong: Sexist Apps, Biased Algorithms, and Other Threats of Toxic Tech by Sara Wachter-Boettcher\\nFrom the book’s description on Amazon:\\n“Buying groceries, tracking our health, finding a date: whatever we want to do, odds are that we can now do it online. But few of us ask how all these digital products are designed, or why. It’s time we change that. Many of the services we rely on are full of oversights, biases, and downright ethical nightmares. Chatbots that harass women. Signup forms that fail anyone who’s not straight. Social media sites that send peppy messages about dead relatives. Algorithms that put more black people behind bars. \\nTechnically Wrong takes an unflinching look at the values, processes, and assumptions that lead to these problems and more. Wachter-Boettcher demystifies the tech industry, leaving those of us on the other side of the screen better prepared to make informed choices about the services we use – and demand more from the companies behind them.”\\n\\n \\nBrotopia: Breaking Up the Boys’ Club of Silicon Valley by Emily Chang\\nFrom the book’s description on Amazon:\\n“Silicon Valley is not a fantasyland of unicorns, virtual reality rainbows, and 3D-printed lollipops for women in tech. Instead, it’s a “Brotopia,” where men hold the cards and make the rules. While millions of dollars may seem to grow on trees in this land of innovation, tech’s aggressive, misogynistic, work-at-all costs culture has shut women out of the greatest wealth creation in the history of the world.\\nBrotopia reveals how Silicon Valley got so sexist despite its utopian ideals, why bro culture endures even as its companies claim the moral high ground, and how women are speaking out and fighting back. Drawing on her deep network of Silicon Valley insiders, Chang opens the boardroom doors of male-dominated venture capital firms like Kleiner Perkins, the subject of Ellen Pao’s high-profile gender discrimination lawsuit, and Sequoia, where a partner once famously said they “won’t lower their standards” just to hire women. Exposing the flawed logic in common excuses for why tech has long suffered the “pipeline” problem and invests in the delusion of meritocracy, Brotopia also shows how bias coded into AI, internet troll culture, and the reliance on pattern recognition harms not just women in tech but us all, and at an unprecedented scale.”\\n\\n \\nLife in Code: A Personal History of Technology by Ellen Ullman\\nFrom the book’s description on Amazon:\\n“The last twenty years have brought us the rise of the internet, the development of artificial intelligence, the ubiquity of once unimaginably powerful computers, and the thorough transformation of our economy and society. Through it all, Ellen Ullman lived and worked inside that rising culture of technology, and in Life in Code she tells the continuing story of the changes it wrought with a unique, expert perspective.\\nWhen Ellen Ullman moved to San Francisco in the early 1970s and went on to become a computer programmer, she was joining a small, idealistic, and almost exclusively male cadre that aspired to genuinely change the world. In 1997 Ullman wrote Close to the Machine, the now classic and still definitive account of life as a coder at the birth of what would be a sweeping technological, cultural, and financial revolution.\\nTwenty years later, the story Ullman recounts is neither one of unbridled triumph nor a nostalgic denial of progress. It is necessarily the story of digital technology’s loss of innocence as it entered the cultural mainstream, and it is a personal reckoning with all that has changed, and so much that hasn’t. Life in Code is an essential text toward our understanding of the last twenty years–and the next twenty.”\\n\\n \\nLet us know your thoughts on this list on social media!

       "      <td>What IT Career should I choose?\\nIf you’re thinking about a career in IT, there are a lot of directions you could go. You could become a web developer or data scientist or study UI/UX and graphic design. Or for those of you reading right now, you might be looking at entering a career in networking, cybersecurity, or cloud administration. Which might lead you to ask: what’s the difference, and which program is right for me?\\nBoth these programs are 13-weeks long. While they have different names, they share a lot of similar content as entry-level IT accelerators. Of the seven technical modules, four of them are shared. Both cover:\\n\\nNetworking – Gain in-depth exposure to networks and topics across the OSI model,  networks, protocols, and packet Capture, network analysis, and more.\\nLinux – Gain exposure and get hands-on configuring and maintaining the Linux operating system.\\nWindows – Exposure to the Windows Server 2012 R2 Operating System to learn server management functions using Server Manager and basic command-line utilities and tools to run from the command prompt.\\nAWS – Become familiar with key industry terms and concepts while building a foundation of cloud product knowledge across Amazon Web Services.\\n\\nNetworking, Linux, Windows, and AWS are a LOT of content for new IT employees. Outside of this content, the programs split into their areas of focus:\\n\\nCyber Cloud gets students certified in Security+ and AWS\\nSystems Engineering gets students certified in Network+ and Linux+\\n\\nNow that you understand where the programs are similar and where they differ, which one is right for you? Here are some questions to consider:\\n\\nDo I have any technical work experience?\\nDo I have any training or education in IT?\\nDo you prefer solving open-ended and ambiguous problems, or concrete problems with solutions?\\nAre you interested in building and developing systems, or in securing and protecting systems?\\n\\nIf you don’t have any work or education in IT, the Systems Engineering program is the one for you. It is designed to be the 0-1 step in your IT career to get you started! If you do have work experience or education in IT, then you might be interested in Cyber Cloud. Why is that?\\nOur programs focus on CompTIA certifications, which is a major industry provider in technical training. The typical track through their IT certifications is to start with their A+, then complete their Network +, and then progress to their Security +. That means if you don’t have your Network + (or relevant experience), it can be really hard to catch up.\\nStill not sure which is right for you?

       "      <td>Codeup offers a 13-week training program: Systems Engineering. Designed to help you launch your career in tech, this program takes you from 0 experience to IT hero with certifications and hands-on experience in just weeks. But if you’re new to tech, you might be wondering…what is Systems Engineering?\\nWhat is Systems Engineering?\\nIn IT terms, a Systems Engineer (Sysadmin or Sysad for short) is responsible for the configuration, upkeep, and operation of computer systems. They manage things like security, storage, automation, troubleshooting, and a whole lot more. For example, some of the day to day tasks include things like:\\n\\nReviewing system logs for anomalies and issues\\nUpdating operating systems (OS)\\nInstalling new hardware and software\\nManaging user accounts\\nDocumenting information about the system setup\\nManaging file systems\\n\\nYou might be thinking, “Woah, that looks like a lot!” and that’s because it is! A Systems Engineer is a critical piece of IT infrastructure. And in today’s digital age, all companies are IT companies, which means Sysadmins are critical everywhere. You can think of a Sysad as a jack-of-all-trades of what we typically think of as IT. But don’t forget how the old saying actually ends: “A jack of all trades is a master of none, but oftentimes better than a master of none.” So, what are the skills a Sysadmin uses?\\n\\nNetworking – Networking skills include how to configure, maintain, and troubleshoot networks, including using hardware like switches, routers, and firewalls. These skills and concepts are crucial to any systems engineering position. You not only need to understand them but also need some way to prove it. With the Network+ certification, job seekers can come to employers with proof of their networking know-how.\\nLinux- Linux is one of the most popular Operating Systems (OS). It is fully compatible with Mac OS and underpins all Android systems. In fact, the world’s IT infrastructure is run primarily on Linux. Certifications are the primary way technical folks prove their skills and Linux is no different. The CompTIA Linux+ certification is an entry-level certification that proves knowledge and basic technical proficiency in the job role\\nCloud – This involves using servers and tools (i.e. processing and storage hardware) that are based in a different location, instead of on-site. Our program introduces students to cloud concepts like storage, computing, permissions, and more!\\n\\nWhy Become a Systems Engineer?\\nNow you know what a Sysadmin does and what skills they use. But why become a Sysadmin? The world is increasingly dependent on computer systems and their underlying technologies. Configuring computer software, designing innovative solutions for specific problems, and basic troubleshooting skills are more and more in demand each year.  Without systems engineers, the technical world would stop innovating and become stagnant.\\n\\nThey are in demand! Companies rely on Sysadmins to keep all their IT running\\nYou’ll become a tech guru! You won’t just be the person who can fix the printer. You’ll also be the person who can script, work with servers, navigate AWS Cloud tools, and work on modern web technologies.\\nYou can specialize! With the breadth of knowledge you’ll obtain, you can have a specialized career in IT. Just hone in on one of your interests, whether it’s security, cloud, databases, or something that doesn’t even exist yet!\\n\\nInterested in learning more?

       "      <td>By: Alicia Gonzalez\\nBefore Codeup, I was a home health Speech-Language Pathologist Assistant. I would go from home to home working with children anywhere from 1 year old to 18 years old. After 5 years of the profession, my body was getting tired driving around all the time and I felt overworked. The work was satisfying and I do miss working with the kiddos, but I just felt drained. I knew it was time to find a different field, so I started thinking about what else I was good at.\\nThen one day as I was on my way to a patient’s home, I found a Codeup billboard near Splashtown that said “drive to a job you love” and I took it as a sign. I thought, “I want to drive to a job I love!” I had also heard nothing but good things about Codeup from a friend that went the Web Development route. She answered my questions and helped me through the whole process.\\nAt first, I was a little worried about tuition payment, but once I got started in the application process, they held Zoom meetings where they would talk about all the funding options. They made it really easy and addressed all of my concerns. I realized I didn’t have to be scared about the financial aspect. I applied to a couple of grants and was able to get about a third of my tuition covered through the Train for Jobs SA grant from Workforce Solutions Alamo. That really helped me. I also received a few different scholarships from Codeup. The rest of it was a loan from Meritize.\\nIt was difficult leaving something I was comfortable and familiar with to start something new with no data science background, but I have always enjoyed all things tech. Once we got into the pre-assessment work and then the prework leading up to class, it showed me, “okay this IS what I wanted to be doing.” I really enjoyed it, thought it was fun, and realized this was for me.\\nOverall, I really enjoyed the program. We were in Zoom the whole time because of the pandemic, but they made it slow, nice, and easy. The instructors are absolutely wonderful. Every single instructor helped me at one point or another, teaching things from ground zero and explaining everything really nicely in a way I can understand. One thing I value the most about the instructors is that, not only do they go over all the necessary skills needed in a data-related career, but they teach us how to learn the skills as well. They didn’t just give us the work and tell us exactly how to do it. They provide instruction, hands-on exercises/projects, and answers to all questions, but most importantly, they walk us through how to work with the data and obtain the answers on our own. This is extremely valuable as I believe it is the key to success in this field.\\nNow after graduating from Codeup, I’m a Business Intelligence Analyst at Liquid Web. I’ve been here almost three months now and I’m contributing to so many projects. I really feel like a true member of the team. I can figure things out for myself and my bosses are telling me how well I’m doing and how far I’ve come since working here. I didn’t have to ask for much help or training, because Codeup prepared me well and taught me how to learn when I run into skills they don’t teach. It’s been really good.\\nI’m so glad I made this change. It was scary to take that leap of faith, but ultimately, I’m really glad I did. I love my job and I love what I’m doing. If anyone is looking to make a career change and struggling to find their best fit, I recommend looking into Codeup and going through their process. I’m extremely happy where I am right now and wouldn’t change a thing.</td>\n",

    "## Stemming\n",
    "\n",
    "Word stems are the base form of a word.\n",
    "\n",
    "We create new words by attaching affixes in a process known as inflection. For example, \"calls\", \"called\", and \"calling\" all share the base stem \"call\".\n",
    "\n",
    "The Porter stemmer is based on the algorithm developed by its inventor, Dr. Martin Porter. Originally, the algorithm is said to have had a total of five different phases for reduction of inflections to their stems, where each phase has its own set of rules.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that usually stemming has a fixed set of rules, hence, the root stems may not be lexicographically correct. This means that the stemmed words may not be semantically correct, and might have a chance of not being present in the dictionary (as we'll see in the output of stemming).\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "## Lemmatization\n",
    "\n",
    "Lemmatization is very similar to stemming, however, the base form in this case is known as the root word, but not the root stem. The difference is that the root word is always a lexicographically correct word (present in the dictionary), but the root stem may not be so. Thus, root word, also known as the lemma, will always be present in the dictionary.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the lemmatization process is considerably slower than stemming, because an additional step is involved where the root form or lemma is formed by removing the affix from the word if and only if the lemma is present in the dictionary.\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "## Removing Stopwords\n",
    "\n",
    "Words which have little or no significance, especially when constructing meaningful features from text, are known as stop words (or stopwords). These are usually words that end up having the maximum frequency if you do a simple term or word frequency in a corpus. Typically, these can be articles, conjunctions, prepositions and so on. Some examples of stopwords: a, an, the, and like.\n",
    "\n",
    "While there is no universal stopword list, we will use a standard English language stopwords list from nltk. You can also add your own domain-specific stopwords as needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before removing stopwords, we want to segment text into linguistic units such as words or numbers. This process is called tokenization."
