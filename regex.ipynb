    "A sort of meta-language with a few applicable uses. Generally speaking, it can be used to describe patterns in text. It falls within the scope of lexical analysis. \n",

    "- Replace or substitute text that matches a pattern.\n",

    "Regular expressions fit under the python standard library ```re``` module. _findall_ will be used most rigorously in this notebook. \n",
    "_findall_ receives a string that is a regular expression, the pattern, and another string that is the string you wish to search; it returns a list of all the times the given regex matches the string. \n",

    "#### Raw Strings\n",
    "##### Any string in python prefixed with an r is a raw string. This means that backslashes will be included in the string verbatim, and don't carry special meaning. It is very common to use raw strings when creating a regular expression.\n",
